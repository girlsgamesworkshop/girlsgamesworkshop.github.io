Since our very first event in November 2016 we always had two workshops per year - a spring edition at the Girls’Day and an autumn edition.</p>

<p>This year we had to cancel our event in March because Germany was in lockdown by then. After a more relaxed summer corona grew stronger in numbers again in autumn - we did not feel comfortable with planning one of our usual events with around 40 people in the same room.</p>

<p>After giving some thoughts, planning and checking out tools we can finally share the good news: We are ready to move our workshop into the digital realm and have our very first remote only workshop!</p>
