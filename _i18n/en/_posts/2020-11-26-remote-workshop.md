Everything turned out a little bit different this year - and our plans for Girls' Games Workshop were no exception. Since our very first event in November 2016 we always had two workshops per year - a spring edition at the Girls'Day and an autumn edition.

This year we had to cancel our event in March because Germany was in lockdown by then. After a more relaxed summer corona grew stronger in numbers again in autumn - we did not feel comfortable with planning one of our usual events with around 40 people in the same room.

After giving some thoughts, planning and checking out tools we can finally share the good news: We are ready to move our workshop into the digital realm and have our very first remote only workshop!
