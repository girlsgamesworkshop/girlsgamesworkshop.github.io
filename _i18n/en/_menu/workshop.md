# The Workshop
Join us for a one day workshop that aims to encourage girls to design and develop games. Participants will be introduced to game design and development in a series of interactive lectures. Using Scratch, a semi-professional game development program, participants will create design documents and playable prototypes of their original game ideas.

This workshop is led by volunteers who work in the gaming industry throughout Germany. It targets girls between the ages 12 -15.

Rough Schedule:
- Morning: Learn about game design through a series of interactive lectures, form teams, come up with a game idea based on the principles learned
- Midday: We will serve lunch, and you will continue to ideate on your game design idea
- Afternoon: Learn how to code using Scratch through a series of interactive lectures, then start programming your game with your team
- Final presentations and feedback (parents are welcome to attend)

Throughout the day, we will have small breaks in which participants can play a variety of video games (like Tower Fall, Duck Game, etc.) setup on gaming consoles in the office.

Attendance is free of charge. The workshop will be conducted in German but English speaking helpers will also be available.
